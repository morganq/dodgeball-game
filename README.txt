GAME:
 - This is a dodgeball game for 2 - 8 players.
 - Players are on either the left or the right team, and to win the round you must knock out all players on the opposing team. You can only walk around freely on your side of the court.
 - You can reduce enemy players' health bars by hitting them with a thrown dodgeball.
 - You can catch a thrown dodgeball to negate the damage and gain possession.
 - Build up super meter by catching thrown balls or by hitting enemies. A fully charged super meter allows you to execute a customized super throw. 

CONTROLS:
 - The arrow keys move around your player
 - X throws a ball if you have one, or grabs a ball if you don't. The ball is thrown in a direction based on the arrow keys that you're holding down. You may pass by throwing to a teammate. He will not be hit if he misses the ball.
 - C jumps. You can jump over the half line, but upon landing you will be forced to run back to your side.
 - Z executes your super throw. If your super meter isn't fully charged, it will execute your EX throw instead.

SUPER / EX THROWS:
Your super throw is a powerful, customized action you can perform whenever you've charged your super meter. You can set up the behavior of the ball you throw by supplying a series of Super Tiles which define the ball's motion and properties. This system is a bit difficult to explain but very intuitive, so i'll give you an example.

If your super sequence is: >>....TTT
the ball's behavior will be to accelerate twice, then continue normally for about half a second, then teleport forward 3 times.

Or for a sequence like: LLDD((((((((>>
the ball's behavior will be to fly high up into the air, come down rapidly, then spin in a full circle before accelerating forwards. 

Each of these Super Tiles costs a certain number of points. EX throws are the same as Super throws except that you only have a very limited number of points to work with. In this way, the EX throw serves as an interesting alternative to your normal throw in certain situations, while your super throw has a very powerful and potentially complex behavior.

EX throws allow a total of 15 points.
Super throws allow a total of 100 points.
